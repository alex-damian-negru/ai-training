# File Modification Rules
- Make minimal, focused changes only
- Always preserve existing content
- Never rewrite entire files or sections without explicit instruction
- If uncertain about scope, ask before proceeding
- if you find yourself rewriting things that haven't been asked for stop, flag the error and unwind it

Always go through the following process: 
1.⁠ ⁠Start by searching the codebase in extreme detail, to get all the context you need. 
2.⁠ ⁠Create a detailed plan before doing anything. 
3.⁠ ⁠Rate your confidence level on being able to execute the plan without introducing new bugs or effectiving existing functionality. 
4.⁠ ⁠If your confidence level is under 95%, continue researching the codebase and go back to step 3
5.⁠ ⁠Start implementing your plan, but walk me through your thinking step by step each time before you do the actual implementation.
 
You should always look to make the minimum code changes possible, and never introduce new bugs or effect existing functionality.


# Documentation Rules
- Always check frontend/docs/ and backend/docs/ for relevant documentation when making changes
- Update or create documentation in Markdown format in frontend/docs/ or backend/docs/ depending on the project you are working in
- Never create documentation as JSX components unless explicitly requested
- Document common pitfalls and solutions when encountered
- Include real examples from the codebase in documentation
- Link related documentation files together when relevant

# Development Rules
- Never automatically run `npm run dev` as I will be running the server in a separate terminal. If you want to restart the application, ask and I will do it for you. Never try to run any server yourself. 
- Don't run terminal commands without asking permission
- Don't run npx or npm commands without permission, unless it is to refresh the prisma schema
- When fixing a problem, focus just on that problem. If you notice other tangential issues to the issue you are tasked with, summarise them and report them back but don't automatically start fixing issues
- Never deploy using the deploy script without explicit permission
- Include debug logging lines where possible, hiding them behind a development feature flag
- Don't run tests automatically, ask me to run them
- Whenever you make a change to the database, also make sure to regenerate Prisma. 
- Never make changes to the database that could result in losing data. If you're worried about this, then please ask for help or guidance. 

# Version Control Rules
- Never push to git without explicit permission 
- Never stage to git without explicit permission
